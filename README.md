## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop and evaluate a deep learning model using the UNet architecture for detecting camouflage in images. The goal is to accurately segment camouflaged objects within various environments.

## Key Activities
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Collecting a diverse dataset of images containing camouflaged objects.
   - Annotating the images with ground truth segmentation masks.
   - Preprocessing the images (e.g., resizing, normalization) to prepare them for model training.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Implementing the UNet architecture for image segmentation.
   - Configuring the model with appropriate layers and hyperparameters.
   - Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **Training the Model**:
   - Training the UNet model on the training dataset.
   - Monitoring training progress and evaluating performance on the validation set.
   - Tuning hyperparameters to improve model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the trained model on the test dataset.
   - Calculating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and IoU (Intersection over Union).
   - Visualizing the segmentation results with example images.

5. **Post-Processing and Analysis**:
   - Applying post-processing techniques to refine segmentation results.
   - Analyzing the model's strengths and weaknesses.
  
## Technology Used
1. **Programming Language**:
   - Python
